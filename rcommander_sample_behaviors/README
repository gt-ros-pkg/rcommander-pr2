The robot_behaviors folder has to have two nested folders (Behaviors and
Behaviors/AR) for ROS Commander to work.  The rosbridge server looks for
behaviors in the AR folder to use for associating with frames defined
by ARToolKit tags.  Once "AR" behaviors are associated with a frame, they
show up in the "Locations" menu.
